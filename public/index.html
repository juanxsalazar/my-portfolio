        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Juan aspires to make a huge positive impact in this world one day. He loves people and wants to find a way to connect the world and make it even more friendly, inclusive, and accessible to everyone. Juan believes technology is one of the ways to accomplish this and as a developer, he has learned how to break down problems into smaller steps and find the solutions to them whether it's through finding the answers online or through asking for help. Juan always finds a way and he loves feedback and learning from his failures.

              <h3>Persistent Learner</h3>
              <p>I love learning even if it's a challenging topic. Going through Suncoast Developers Guild, a fast pace coding boot camp, taught me that I'm a persistent learner.
                Even though there was plenty of times where I felt overwhelmed and behind when it came to learning how to code, I never gave up, and I kept pushing myself to keep on learning. 
                That's why when it comes to learning any new skills or information in life, I know that if put my mind to it, I can learn anything.

              <h3>Courageous Explorer</h3>
              <p>In high school, I used to be shy and never really did much until the end of senior year. At that point, I've realized how much I missed out on
                in life and decided to change in college. When I went to USF St Pete, I was to overcome my shyness by getting out of my comfort zone and getting support from friends. It's one of my proudest accomplishments and it taught me that I'm a courageous explorer. I love getting out of my comfort zone and facing my fears. </p>

                  <p>I love people, I believe in the good in people. I want to make an impact, because their's so many people out there that are amazing and 
                    deserve an opportunity to go after what they want and sometimes they don't get the opportunity to because of the situation they been thrown in life. That's why I love connecting people to one another.
                    I believe if we as a community truly knew one another, we would always be more willing to help one another when complicated situation arises, so I love connecting people to one another, I want to see a world 
                    where everyone is friends with one another.
